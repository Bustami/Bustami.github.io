      <description>In this article I am going to tell you what the passing networks are and how to create them, in addition to share with you some R codes that I prepared for that and some examples cases.
If you don’t consider yourself a football analytics nerd and you have not seen yet the slides from the presentations “A look into Soccer Analytics using R” and “Soccer Analytics: A data revolution” I would suggest to check them in order to be familiar with the data types and terminology mentioned here.</description>
