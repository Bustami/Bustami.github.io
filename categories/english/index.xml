      <description>Along this article I am going to share some detail which could be useful if you want to fit your own xG model, in addition to its respective performance evaluation and results analysis.
What is xG?The xG (eXpected Goals) is the main metric used into the Football Analytics field nowadays. In simple words, it is the probability (from 0 to 1) that a shot has to become in a goal.</description>

      <description>I couldn’t resist doing some data analysis for this new Soccer World Cup in Russia 2018. After searching online for a while and collecting some data I decided to focus on creating a prediction model for “expected goals for each team and each game”, allowing the estimation of probability to win, lose or draw. This way we can predict all games of the tournament.
Now all details about the considered data, model fitting and results are presented.</description>
